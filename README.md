<!-- # OpenSource for Beginners

First time open source seems very confusing.
<br>
Althought initially open source might seem a bit tricky and complicated for the first timers. But believe me once you get hold of the basic functionalities you'll start loving it.


Therefore we came up with a practise enviroment to make you first open source contribution easy. 


## Steps to get Started
* fork this repository to you own github account
* open the CONTRIBUTORS.md file in the forked repository
* add your name and github profile link and a 3-4 word bio about yourself following the same format.
* Open a Pull request - If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

* Now submit the pull request!

Soon your changes will be reviewed and the PR will be merged if the changes are legit!


## CongratulationsðŸ’¥
You made your first pull request
